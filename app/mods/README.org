* Synthesizer
  1. Present
     - project runs as a CLI
     - shows the inertial path along with the absolute path
  2. Future
     - have an on/off for a grid on synth
     - have an on/off for the inertial path to be shown
     - show time/omega as animation progresses
     - have different grid options (i.e. concentric circles or square grid)

* DigiPyRo
  1. Present
     - project runs as a CLI
     - rotates a film dependent on the RPM given
  2. Future
     - Fix elliptical warping that happens on some films being scaled
     - Have so side-by-side of rotated and de-rotated films
     - Enable particle tracking
     - have a timestamp shown on the film
